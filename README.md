Automated Timetable Scheduling System
• Developed a Python-based automated scheduling tool applying CSP and A.I. techniques, significantly streamlining
timetable creation.
• Reduced execution times by over 60% through the implementation of advanced heuristics, increasing
overall system efficiency.
• Showcased problem-solving and technical efficiency in algorithm optimization for real-world.
